# craftorcrap - Pitch Deck

## The Problem

Creative feedback is broken:
- **Dribbble/Behance:** Echo chambers of likes, no honest critique
- **Pinterest/Cosmos:** Save inspiration, but no community curation
- **Asking friends:** Biased feedback from people who know you
- **Client feedback:** Scattered across email, Slack, comments

Creatives need honest, unbiased feedback on their work.

---

## The Solution

**craftorcrap** - Anonymous community voting meets personal curation.

Simple mechanic: **Craft** (good) or **Crap** (bad)

- No follower counts
- No popularity bias
- Just honest opinions on the work itself

---

## How It Works

### Public (Free)
- Browse and vote on submissions (anonymous voting)
- Save favorites to personal boards
- Organize inspiration (like Cosmos, but free)
- Submit your own work for community feedback

### Solo (£4.99/month)
- Create shareable voting boards
- Share links with clients, friends, or your community
- Password protection for private feedback
- **Spin up your own mini craft-or-crap** for your audience

### Studio (£24.99/month)
- Everything in Solo
- Team collaboration
- Multiple seats
- Custom branding
- Analytics dashboard

## Why This is Different

| Platform | Save & Organize | Honest Voting | Create Your Own Community |
|----------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Pinterest | Yes | No | No |
| Cosmos | Yes (paid) | No | No |
| Dribbble | No | No (likes only) | No |
| **craftorcrap** | **Yes (free)** | **Yes (anonymous)** | **Yes (Solo)** |

We give away what others charge for. We monetize collaboration.

## Business Model

**Freemium SaaS**

| Tier | Price | Target |
|------|-------|--------|
| Free | £0 | Creatives discovering the platform |
| Solo | £4.99/mo | Freelancers, content creators, small teams |
| Studio | £24.99/mo | Agencies, studios, larger teams |

**Growth Loop:**
1. Free users vote & save (hooked on curation)
2. Need client feedback → Solo
3. Team needs it → Studio

## Market Opportunity

- 50M+ designers worldwide
- Creator economy growing rapidly
- Remote work = more async feedback needed
- Every YouTuber, streamer, brand needs audience engagement

**Adjacent markets:**
- Polls & surveys (Typeform)
- Client feedback (Frame.io)
- Community engagement (Discord tools)
- Design inspiration (Pinterest, Cosmos)

## Competitive Advantage

1. **Anonymous voting** - Honest in a way social platforms can never be
2. **Free personal curation** - Undercuts Cosmos pricing
3. **Community-powered discovery** - Quality rises, not popularity
4. **Platform play** - Users create their own voting communities
